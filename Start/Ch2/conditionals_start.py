# Example file for working with conditional statements

x, y = 10, 100

# conditional flow uses if, elif, else
if x < y:
  print("'x' is less than 'y'")

if x < y:
  print("'x' is less than 'y'")
elif x == y:
  print("'x' is the same as 'y'")
else:
  print("'x' is greater than 'y'")

# conditional statements let you use "a if C else b"
result = "'x' is less than 'y'" if (x < y) else "'x' is greater or equal to 'y'"
print(result)
